# Snake reinforcement
## AI model, trained using reinforcement learning to play snake game

* Training an AI model to play a game of snake
* The game is created using PyTorch
* The model has been trained using QLearning method

### Installation
* Make sure that python has been installed in the system. Alternatively, a virtual environment can also be used
* Install the libraries:<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
* Run the model:<br>
```python run.py```

### Issues:
<code>
UserWarning: Creating a tensor from a list of numpy.ndarrays is 
extremely slow. Please consider converting the list to a single numpy.ndarray with numpy.array() before    
converting to a tensor.
